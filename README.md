### Test coverage:

- [ ] Require a local file
- [ ] Require a local file a directory above
- [ ] Require a local file a directory below

- [ ] Require a package file with an index.js
- [ ] Require a package file which specifies a different main property in package.json
- [ ] Require a package file which is a directory above and has an index.js
- [ ] Require a package file which is a directory below and has an index.js
- [ ] Require a package file relative to the package directory (is this possible?)
